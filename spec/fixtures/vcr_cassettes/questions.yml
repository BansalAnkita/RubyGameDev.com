        occur again, so phases are sometimes conditional. </p>\n\n<p>What''s more,

        opinion-based","title":"How can I improve this architecture?","body":"<p>In
        <a href=\"https://github.com/matheusmoreira/survivor\" rel=\"nofollow\">a
        roguelike I''m developing in Ruby</a>, I started with a traditional object
        hierarchy where all game logic relevant to creatures were contained in the
        <code>Creature</code> class. Movement logic, for example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Creature.instance_methods(false)    #
        =&gt; [ :move ]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In my design, the map and creatures are
        decoupled: the map has no idea what''s on a tile and the creature has no idea
        which kind of tile it is on. What brings them together are coordinates.</p>\n\n<p>Movement
        logic requires information about where on the map the creature is, so the
        creature would need access to the map. The map belonged to the game, so I
        just added a game attribute to every creature as a quick solution. I didn''t
        really want to pass a map instance every time the creature needed to move
        around because the map the creature is on isn''t likely to change.</p>\n\n<p>In
        the end, I removed the game logic from the <code>Creature</code> class, and
        separated them into modules:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Game::Logic::Movement.singleton_methods(false)    #
        =&gt; [ :move ]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The way I understand it, these logic
        modules integrate multiple game parts which depend on each other in a way
        not easily expressed hierarchically. The methods are just algorithms that
        operate on the given information. For example, the implementation of the <code>move</code>
        method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>def self.move(creature, map, dx, dy)\n  coordinates
        = Map::Coordinates[dx + creature.x, dy + creature.y]\n  tile = map[coordinates]\n  creature.coordinates
        = coordinates if tile and tile.passable? # Teleport!\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>These
        methods are called directly from the game loop:</p>\n\n<pre><code>def handle(input)\n  case
        input\n    when :up then Logic::Movement.move character, map, 0, 1\n    #
        ...\n  end\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is how the game is currently organized.
        Movement is the only game logic I''ve added as of now, so I think it would
        be wise if I revised the architecture while it is still small. So, what do
        you think of it? What are the problems, and what can I do to improve it?</p>\n\n<p>I''m
        also interested in how it compares to component-based game architecture. I''ve
        read a lot about it during my research, and it seems to be the most maintainable
        and reusable way to write game code. I think it would fit naturally in the
        Ruby world, due to its dynamic nature and message-based method invocation.
        The thing is, I really never understood how different components interact
        with each other, and I''m looking for something I can make sense of.</p>\n"},{"tags":["3d","engine","ruby","jmonkeyengine","teaching"],"owner":{"reputation":134,"user_id":12887,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d2c037ce48d12bd88ec6529f9bb39f0a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"at.","link":"http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/12887/at"},"is_answered":true,"view_count":925,"closed_date":1327562037,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1327547860,"creation_date":1327480953,"last_edit_date":1327547860,"question_id":22894,"link":"http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/22894/teaching-game-development-with-ruby","closed_reason":"not

        problem is that with these numbers, the ball collides near the player sometimes,
        even though the dimensions of the player are correct.</p>\n\n<p>So my question
        is from where does the x values start to count? Is it from the center of gravity
        of the image or from the beginning of the image? (i.e When you add the image
        on a specific x,y,z what are these values compared to the image?</p>\n"},{"tags":["collision-detection","ruby","libgosu"],"owner":{"reputation":103,"user_id":48131,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"http://i.stack.imgur.com/OFLQf.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mhmd","link":"http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/48131/mhmd"},"is_answered":true,"view_count":112,"accepted_answer_id":77649,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1402762009,"creation_date":1402754870,"last_edit_date":1402761443,"question_id":77644,"link":"http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/77644/collision-detection-in-ruby","title":"Collision

        the ball reaches the left (or right) side of the paddle while it''s moving.
        this will cause the ball to move into the inside of the paddle,which seems
        strange.</p>\n\n<p>What should I do to fix this?</p>\n"},{"tags":["2d","ruby","libgosu"],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":39097,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/22581b8ea7b10b7edb6b398cc1048d2c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ekharrtoll","link":"http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/39097/ekharrtoll"},"is_answered":true,"view_count":252,"accepted_answer_id":65981,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1409301146,"creation_date":1384700816,"question_id":65968,"link":"http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/65968/finding-tilex-and-tiley-based-on-x-and-y-and-vice-versa-in-isometric-2d-view","title":"Finding

        like way. But I''m having a problem with calculating two things. \n- Entity''s
        tile_x and tile_y (on which tile is the entity positioned) when given x and
        y, and;\n- Entity''s x and y when I''m sending it''s tile_x and tile_y.</p>\n\n<p>One
        method is pretty much the other one reversed. I tried various methods I found
        over internet, but either I''m doing something wrong, or I don''t understand
